Prepared by Giacomo Bertoldi, February 2020

We consider here three test cases:

- **Borden05m**: it is a laboratory catchment to test discharge simulation
- **ColdelaPorte**: it is a snow obervation site to test plot scale cryospheric variables simulation
- **Matsch_B2_Ref_007**: it is a an experimentaö site to test plot scale water and energy fluxes simulation
